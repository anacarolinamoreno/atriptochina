# DeepSeek prompt

For this project, I used Deep Seek to turn a messy text into a structured Python dictionary.
<br>

Overall it took me six prompts to get to a dictionary that was decent enough to move to a Python notebook.
<br>

First, I simply tried asking it to turn the data into a table, and set the names of the columns.

| ------------- | ------------- |

Right away it was able to structure the table, but I noticed some quick cleaning possibilites. I asked it to remove all mentions of " RMB" (the Chinese currency, including the space), from the column that shows the price of things:

Looks like it worked! So I asked it for two more things:
<br>
1- To replace every "-" int the "who paid" column by "Carol" (because I knew on the first few days we had used my balance account to pay for everything, and only started separating the payment sources afterwards). A basic task I could have used Python for, but this was faster.
<br>
2- To create a new column called "category", and to use the column where the expense was described to classify each expense as either "transportation", "food", "hotel", "entrance tickets" and "shopping/presents/souvernirs". This was the biggest ask, but at first glance it seemed to work OK. It recognized "Didi" (the Chinese car app) and "Metr√¥" as transportation, words like "dinner", "lunch", "apple juice", "coffee" and "water" as food and objects as shopping.
<br>
It also kept gave me its reasoning behind the classification.

Now I was satisfied with the table, so I asked it to turn it into a dictionary. This is where it got a bit lazy: it only gave me some of it, and taught me how to do the rest. So I asked it once more to deliver me the complete dictionary, which **apparently** it did:

| A lazy answer:  | The full answer (supposedly): |
| ------------- | ------------- |

I saved that dictionary [into a .py file](../00_raw/china_raw.py), changing the name of object to English, and took it to Jupyter Lab to fact-check if my data is all there. But when I started, it became clear a json would be much more handy, so I went back to DeepSeek for a final prompt and got what I needed:
